                            Kairo was impressive to see. It has a lot of dirrefent areas and people, but the most exciting thing i saw was the pyramids.
                            They were a lot bigger than i imagined and also the History behind them is fascinating.

                            There is a lot of fun things to do for example shopping or go to a beautiful beach.
                            The food is more expensive than in smaller towns but it also has the best locations to eat out.
